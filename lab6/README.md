<br>  Image Filtering and Edge Detection (2D Convolution Method), used Python3 + NumPy + MatplotLib + individual implementations

The mathematics for many filters can be expressed in a principal manner using 2D convolution, such as smoothing and sharpening images and detecting edges. Convolution in 2D operates on two images, with one functioning as the input image and the other, called the kernel, serving as a filter. It expresses the amount overlap of one function as it is shifted over another function, as the output image is produced by sliding the kernel over the input image. Below some samples :
